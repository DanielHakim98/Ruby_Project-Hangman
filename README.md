# Ruby_Project-Hangman
* This will be next Ruby project that I'll be working on. After so long taking rest from web development, now it's time to get back to it.
* Starting from this project, I'll try my best to create a clear pseudocode and flowchart before actually jump into coding.
* For this project, I also have to add save game features in this game by applying serialization technique.

* Add "Hangman_Psedocode.rb" to have an overall overview of the program flow for Hangman.
* The pseudocode later will be converted to flowchart for proper presentation of the program code.
* Might as well to implement it in Python.
